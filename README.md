### <ins>Battleship Description</ins>
Battleship is a 2-player board game. To start the game, each player places 5 ships (battleship, destroyer, minesweeper, and submarine) on their board. Each player then has the opportunity to end the game, move their fleet (north, east, south, or west), attack their opponent, or use a perk. For the perks, a player can use a nuke, sonar, or B2-Bomber once they have met certain conditions that unlock individual perks. The game ends when one of the players decides to end the game on their turn, or a player sinks all of their opponentâ€™s ships.

### <ins>Coding Standards</ins>
Our group has agreed to adhere to and apply the Google Java Style Guide. We feel this is a succinct and concise java style guide and adhering to it serves to benefit us should we later decide to apply for jobs at Google. Additionally, we chose Google's style guide because they are a reputable tech company with products that have scaled well, which means they have a well maintained code base. Google has made the documentation for their style guide public and it can be found at the following link: https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html.

### <ins>Design Process</ins>
We agreed to build our project using a Agile (Extreme Programming) and Kanban hybrid methodology. Our project board is already integrated into our project repository under the project tab. We plan on doing two week sprints. We have laid out 5 columns in our github:<br>
* Brainstorming/Backlog 
* To Do
* In Progress 
* Testing 
* Done<br>

This allows us to better organize what we need to accomplish during a sprint. Our backlog column will hold all tasks that we know that we will have to do over the course of the project. The To do column will be for tasks that will be done during the current sprint. The In Progress column will be for things that are currently being worked on. The Testing column will be tasks that need to be tested by other team members so ensure each aspect is working correctly. Last, the Done column will be for tasks that have been completed. We plan on clearing the Done column after each sprint to stay organized. We will also assign ourselves to a task, so that github will tell other team members what team member is working on a specific task. This hybrid approach allows us to incorporate various design methodologies to achieve the best of what agile, continuous scrum, and Kanban have to offer.
